// this is a simple rule for allowing anyone to create messages
// it's not necessary to implement anything else since I want anyone to write me messages without authentication
// and I'm the only one who can read them
// firestore prevents attacks of any kind
// the only problem I would have with this implementation would be someone trying to insert too much data in the database
// which would increase charges, but my hosting plan does not allow for that, so I'm safe with that too
