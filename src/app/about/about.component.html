    <p class="first-paragraph">Hi there! I'm Richard William. I'm a {{getAge()}} years old software developer and digital content producer from Brazil. I started my carrer in 2013 creating simple desktop applications for a child's care government organization, but I started playing around with video and image editing softwares since I was 14, and coding when I was 16. Later on I entered a game development course at Unisinos in Porto Alegre, Brazil, and there was where I discovered that my passion was creating interactive and fun applications, even though people would use it the wrong way, so I took a few design classes and found out the wrong one was me. I've been breathing and eating code and design since then. I can't stop. And I don't want to.</p>
    <p class="second-paragraph">Now I'm a freelancer who is always learning new technologies and seeking challenging projects. Another true passion in my life is my family, which I love to spend my free time with.</p>
